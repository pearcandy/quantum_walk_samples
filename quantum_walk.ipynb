    "## Quantum Walk \n",
    "A quantum walk is the \"quantum version\" of a classical random walk. This means the coin function will be a Unitary gate ($U(2)$) which is non-random and reversible:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p+q = U \\in U(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use a Hadamard gate for executing the coin function since it puts our qubits in a state of superposition, allowing for the  simulation of a coin based probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$H=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left [{\\begin{array}{rr}1 & 1 \\\\ 1 & -1\\\\ \\end{array}}\\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of random walks, continuous and discrete, and in this notebook we will use the discrete framework. In the discrete, unitary operations are made of coin and shift operators $U = SC$ which work in a state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is represented by an arbitrary undirected graph $G(V,E)$ where $V = {v_1, v_2, ..v_n}$ as nodes on the graph and $E = {(v_x, v_y) , ( v_i, v_j) â€¦}$ as edges that combine different nodes together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum walk extends into a position space where each node $v_i$ has a certain valency $d_i$ and is split into $d_i$ subnodes. The shifting operator then acts as $S (v_i, a_i) = (v_j, a_j)$ and with the coin operator, are unitary gates which combine the probability amplitudes with individual subnodes under each node.\n",
    "\n",
    "A unitary of $v_i$ with valency $d_i$ can be represented as $(d_i \\times d_i)$. The total state of system is defined by the Hilbert space \n",
    "\n",
    "$$H = H_c + H_p$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $H_C$ is the coin Hilbert space and $H_P$ is the position Hilbert space. "
